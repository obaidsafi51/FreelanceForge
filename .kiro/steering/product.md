# FreelanceForge Product Overview

## What is FreelanceForge?

FreelanceForge is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Polkadot blockchain that aggregates freelance credentials into portable, verifiable NFT-based digital identities. It addresses the critical problem of credential fragmentation across multiple platforms in the $1.2 trillion gig economy.

## Core Problem

Freelancers maintain separate profiles across multiple platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, LinkedIn, etc.) with no way to aggregate their reputation data. This leads to:

- Manual verification burden (2-3 hours per application)
- Platform lock-in and data ownership issues
- Cross-border trust deficits
- Fraud risk from fabricated credentials

## Solution

FreelanceForge enables freelancers to:

- Mint soulbound NFT credentials for skills, reviews, certifications, and payment history
- Calculate automated trust scores (0-100) from aggregated credentials
- Export and share verifiable portfolios via JSON/QR codes
- Own their professional reputation data permanently

## Key Features

- **NFT Credential Minting**: Immutable, soulbound tokens representing professional achievements
- **Trust Score Algorithm**: Weighted calculation (60% reviews, 30% skills, 10% payments)
- **Portfolio Dashboard**: Timeline view with filtering and responsive design
- **Export & Sharing**: JSON export and public portfolio links with privacy controls
- **Mock Data Import**: JSON upload from existing Web2 platforms

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Freelancers (developers, designers, writers) aged 25-45 with basic Web3 knowledge
- **Secondary**: Recruiters, DAOs, Web3 project managers seeking verified talent
- **Tertiary**: Platform integrators and educational institutions

## Success Metrics

- Transaction cost: <0.01 DOT per credential mint
- Dashboard load time: <2 seconds
